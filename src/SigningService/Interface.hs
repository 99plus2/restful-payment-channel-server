Module      : SigningService.Interface
Description : Publish settlement transactions when given payment channel states

Stability   : experimental
Portability : POSIX

A service that runs somewhere safe, although reachable from the outside, which keeps the
 server private key, and produces a settlement transaction for each ReceiverPaymentChannel
 it receives. This service is configured with the private key whose public
 counterpart is advertized by PayChanServer, as well as a funds destination address,
 and will only produce settlement transactions paying to this pre-defined address.

This file describes the server interface (currently comprising 'signSettlementTx' only).
