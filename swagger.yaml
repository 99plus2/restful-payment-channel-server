  title: RESTful Bitcoin payment channel protocol
  description: |
    A Bitcoin payment channel enables instant, secure & fee-less transfer of bitcoins from one party to another. The intended use is consumer-to-merchant payments, allowing a consumer to make many small payments to a merchant - with whom the consumer has an open payment channel - while only paying the Bitcoin transaction fee once, when the channel is closed.
    
    The payment server speaking this protocol is the recipient of value, operating on behalf of a content delivery server who receives value from a customer/client. The content delivery server passes requests supplied by the client (payer) to the payment server, and delivers content to the client dependent on the response from the payment server. 
    
    * Server implementation: https://github.com/runeksvendsen/restful-payment-channel-server
    * Client library: https://github.com/runeksvendsen/paychanjs-client
    
    Changes from version 1 to 2:
      * The outpoint that the payment transaction redeems is now no longer static, but will change when the server needs to free the value it has received over the channel. This enables the server to make use of the value it has received without closing the payment channel. If a client attempts to make a payment over a channel whose source of funding has changed, it will receive a "301 Moved" response, and the payment must now use the funding outpoint specified by the new location URL.
      * Instead of the client specifying a change address upon opening a channel, the channel funding address is instead used as the change address for the purpose of making payments, and now the client only needs to specify a change address when it wishes to close the channel.

      description: |
        Before opening a payment channel with the server, the client must first acquire the server public key, in order to calculate a funding address for the channel.
      
        The client will first calculate the funding address, confirm that it matches the server's, then pay to the funding address, and wait until the funding transaction has the server-specified number of confirmations ("funding_tx_min_conf").
        
        After this, the client will create a new payment of value equal to the server-specified channel open price ("open_price"), and POST this to the channel-open URL in order to open the channel.

      dust_limit:
        description: The server will not accept payments where the client change amount is less than this amount. This "dust limit" is necessary in order to avoid producing a settlement transaction that will not circulate in the Bitcoin P2P network because it contains an output of minuscule value. Consequently, the maximum amount, that can be sent over the payment channel, is the amount sent to the funding address minus this "dust limit".
      funding_address_copy:
        description: Server derived channel funding address. The client will confirm that its own derived funding address matches this one, before paying to it.

      settlement_period_hours:
        description: The server reserves the right to close the payment channel this many hours before the specified expiration date. The server hasn't received any actual value until it publishes a payment transaction to the Bitcoin network, so it needs a window of time in which the client can no longer send payments over the channel, and yet the channel refund transaction hasn't become valid.
