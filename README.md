#### Server implementation of the [RESTful Bitcoin Payment Channel Protocol](http://paychandoc.runeks.me/)
---

### What is this?
This server allows the operator to, after an initial setup step involving the sender, receive multiple, instant Bitcoin payments (no waiting for confirmations) from this pre-defined sender; paying the Bitcoin transaction fee only once, when the channel is closed.

So, a client contacts the server for funding information, pays to a derived funding address, notifies the server of this, and then the payment channel is open. Payments sent over the channel do not touch the blockchain, so 1-Satoshi payments are fine, and as many can be sent until all the value, sent in the funding transaction, has been used up. The channel can also be closed before that, in which case the client's unspent value is returned to the client change address.

A payment channel also has a pre-defined expiration date. After this date, the client can reclaim all value sent over the channel, if it hasn't been closed yet. For the client, this means that opening a payment channel is trustless because, in case the server/receiver disappears, the client can just wait for the expiration date and reclaim funds. For the receiver, it means that the payment channel server must always be running if it has open payment channels. Not the least in order to be able to receive payments over these open channels in the first place, but also to be able to close channels before they reach expiration.

### Use cases
One could imagine, for example, setting up a service which sends video in response to payments, the first minute being free (if you have an open payment channel), and then charging, say 0.1 cent per second thereafter. Trustless pay-per-view. This server would only be used to verify payments, so an additional protocol, for sending video packets in response to payments, would have to be created.

### Stability
Under development. Mature enough to play with, but definitely not ready for production yet. Everything should work, but both the protocol and the server data structures and interface can still change at any time.

### Bugs/questions
If you find a bug please create an issue here. If you need help, like if I haven't made it clear how to do something or just general support, creating an issue is fine too.

### Build instructions
The following works with a fresh `ubuntu:16.04` docker image

    apt-get update && apt-get install -y libssl-dev autoconf autogen libtool xz-utils git-core haskell-stack
    git clone https://github.com/runeksvendsen/restful-payment-channel-server.git
    cd restful-payment-channel-server/
    stack setup && stack build
    
For distributions without the `haskell-stack` package available, stack (the build tool) can be installed easily with a single command: [https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/#how-to-install](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/#how-to-install).
    
### Running
The payment channel server consists of three executables:

* `PayChanServer` (client facing; implements payment channel protocol) `server.cfg`
* `ChanStore` (database; stores open payment channel states) `store.cfg`
* `SigningService` (private key custodian; signs Bitcoin settlement transactions) `signing.cfg`
    
Each executable takes a single required argument: the path to its config file.

Example config files can be found in `config/`, which has config files for Bitcoin livenet, testnet, and a debug configuration which does not reach out to the Bitcoin network. See `config/live/`, `config/test/` and `config/debug/`, respectively.
    
For `PayChanServer`, you can set the desired listening port via the `PORT` environment variable. Eg.:

    PORT=43617 PayChanServer config/live/config/server.cfg
    
The `runEverything.sh` script runs all three components, taking as argument the root path of the config you want to use, eg. `config/debug/`:

    ./runEverything.sh config/debug/

### Documentation
See [http://paychandoc.runeks.me/](http://paychandoc.runeks.me/).

### Testing
The `benchPayChanServer.sh` script (located in `test/`) executes a payment session (open,pay,close), performing a specified number of payments, for each thread. Usage:

    # First start server, in separate terminal (note pubkey):
    ./runEverything.sh config/debug/
    # Then execute test threads (1000 payments, 10 threads), passing the server pubkey as the last argument:
    ./benchPayChanServer.sh 1000 10 localhost:8000 0225b3aaf58992a8cc909522c2ec859ef218fd29fda0a6723cfb4e0529f80cc8f3

### Performance
On my 2015 Macbook Pro I get ~900 payments per second running the `benchPayChanServer.sh` script:

    $ time ./benchPayChanServer.sh 2000 5 localhost:8000 0225b3aaf58992a8cc909522c2ec859ef218fd29fda0a6723cfb4e0529f80cc8f3
    [...]
    Waiting for clients to terminate...
    Done. Executed 10000 payments.

### TODO

* Write test for expiration-based settlement (separate out into separate executable?)
* ~~Actually close channel before expiration date (write settlement service)~~
